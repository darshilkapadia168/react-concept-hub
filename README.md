React Practice Concepts

A collection of all the React concepts I practiced while learning React.
This repository contains small, focused examples for each topic — simple, easy to understand, and beginner-friendly.

🧠 Concepts Covered

1. Components

Building UI using reusable functional components

Passing data using props

Maintaining clean component structure

Breaking UI into small, manageable parts

2. CSS Module

Applying scoped component-level styles

Avoiding global CSS conflicts

Importing styles directly into components

Using unique class names generated by modules

3. useState Hook

Creating and storing component state

Updating values and triggering re-renders

Managing simple UI logic

Handling numbers, strings, arrays, and objects

4. Advanced useState

Updating objects and arrays by creating a new copy instead of mutating state

Using functional updates when the new value depends on the previous state

Properly handling nested state by updating each level immutably

Ensuring React gets a new state reference to trigger re-renders

5. Form Handling

Managing input values with state

Handling form submission properly

Using controlled components

Updating UI based on user inputs

6. Two-Way Binding

Syncing state with input fields

Updating UI instantly as the user types

Making form elements reflect state changes

Useful mainly for form inputs

7. Local Storage

Saving data in the browser using localStorage

Retrieving stored values when the app loads

Syncing localStorage with component state

Persisting user data across refresh

8. API Call in React

Fetching data using fetch or axios

Handling loading and error states

Updating UI after data retrieval

Displaying dynamic data from APIs

9. useEffect Hook

Running side effects in components

Controlling execution using dependency arrays

Fetching data or updating the DOM on load

Cleaning up effects when needed

10. React Router Dom

Setting up multiple pages in a React app

Navigating using Link and Route

Managing URL-based component rendering

Enabling smooth page transitions

11. Advanced Routing

Creating dynamic routes using params

Handling nested routes

Passing data through URLs

Structuring complex navigation flows

12. Context API

Sharing data globally across components without prop drilling

Creating and providing context using createContext and Context.Provider

Consuming shared values using useContext

Managing global state for themes, user data, or settings
